# Fall16-Team19

 Project Name: Bene-Decluttering Or Lessen


ABSTRACT


Introduction

This project implementation focuses on selling the items donated with less operational cost. This can be attained by proving platform donors and buyers where donors will upload images of items they wish to donate into website portal, these uploads are available to see for all the other users. Then the mediator can decide on date and place for event nearer to both donors and buyers so that donors can drop by items at event and those items can be bought by buyers same day. Then event alert will be sent to social media to let people know about venue and date. This implementation will reduce the operational costs as items donated will get sold the same day eliminating storage and logistic costs.


Problem Statement

Savers/goodwill/salvation having stores and will  gather goods for sale at its stores which requires storage cost, maintenance cost and logistics cost to gather goods from donors. This results in increased operational cost. Through this implementation our goal is to minimize operational cost.  
  
Procedures

Our approach to minimize operational cost involves implementing a portal as a platform for donors and buyers and sending event alerts on social media bringing awareness among people so that they can buy items they want from event.   


Results

This will result in reduced operational cost as items donated will get sold the same day excluding the need to gather items from donors, storage and maintenance costs .


Conclusions

So the idea is to implement a platform which brings donors and buyers together and to generate  revenue from items donated with lowest operating costs.
